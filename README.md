# CreditsStress

Please ensure you have your "keys" file inside the location where you are running the program from.
The wallet which the "keys" file contains should have atleast 1000 credits.
When starting the program you will get a the credits wallet opening up. DO NOT CLOSE THIS just minimize it.

The program will generate 10 source wallets and make the original wallet send 100 credits each to source wallets.
The source wallets will then send 0.0001 CS to one of these random wallets.
